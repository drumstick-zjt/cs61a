### 1. Arithmetic expressions

- Floating point division (`/`): divides the first number number by the second, evaluating to a number with a decimal point *even if the numbers divide evenly*.
- Floor division (`//`): divides the first number by the second and then rounds down, evaluating to an integer.
- Modulo (`%`): evaluates to the **positive** remainder left over from division.
